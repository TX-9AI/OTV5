analysis/volatility_engine.py  v4.4
v4.4  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r221 (UTIL.1) — comment only: state.vwap is a frame-wide VWAP spanning more than one session, not the session VWAP (derived.anchors.vwap_now); names kept because they are recorded keys.
v4.3  2026-08-28  r175: VolatilityState carries df_5m (the frame its ATR
      was read from) so TCS can measure the session's realized drift from the
      same series — pop_drift's mu input.
v4.2  2026-08-24  r96 THE ATR UNIT MISMATCH THAT COST EVERY ORB TRADE.
      `atr_normalized` is atr/price - a FRACTION - and its own comment called it
      "ATR as % of price". Every strategy threshold is in PERCENT
      (ORB_ATR_FLOOR_PCT 0.05, RUNAWAY_ATR_FLOOR_PCT 0.08, the ATR->delta map,
      SWEEP_CS_ATR_MAX_PCT 0.20), all traceable to measurements stated in
      percent. So the ORB floor demanded atr_normalized >= 0.05, i.e. a FIVE
      PERCENT intraday ATR, which never happens: ORB could not fire on any box
      on any day. Observed live 2026-08-24 on NFLX - a textbook break+retest
      confirmed at 09:58 ET, strike picked (C 81.0 @ 0.85, delta 0.389), then
      "ATR 0.004% is below the reachable floor (0.05%)" once per tick for 62
      minutes until the 11:00 cutoff. True ATR was 0.4%, EIGHT TIMES ABOVE the
      floor. The same mismatch failed OPEN on the sweep, whose 0.20 ceiling is a
      MAX: fed 0.004 it never tripped, so "too hot for a boundary to hold" has
      been dead since the split.
      FIX: add `atr_pct` (percent) derived from atr_normalized, and point the
      GATES at it. atr_normalized keeps its fraction semantics because five
      tables already hold fractions and rescaling the producer would change what
      that column means mid-stream with nothing marking the seam.
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

ATR, Bollinger bands, VWAP, price-vs-band, compression state.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

ATR expansion/contraction, Bollinger Band compression,
and VIX-based macro volatility context.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
