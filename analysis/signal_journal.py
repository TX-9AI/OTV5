analysis/signal_journal.py  v4.4
v4.4  2026-09-25  OTV4TEST r144 — THE JOURNAL DIRECTORY IS OVERRIDABLE: OT_SIGNAL_JOURNAL_DIR.
      2026-09-25: the boot sweep's ORB checkers wrote 126 retest_check fixture events into the LIVE
      data/signal_journal/<date>/QQQ.jsonl on this box every morning, and on SOFI and AAL the pusher
      filed them under sym=QQQ in the warehouse - ~76 per box per BOOT, about 320 fabricated
      events in QQQ's real partition (byte-identical 71,944-byte files on two boxes). r13 and r109
      isolated the three stores; the journal was the fourth writer and nobody had redirected it.
      Unset, it is the repo's data/signal_journal exactly as before; the boot sweep
      and the lander now point it at each checker's scratch.
v4.3  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r105 - the `sweep_age_bars` factor column is
      REMOVED. It was None on every strategy but the sweep and a hardcoded 0 on
      that one, so it was never a factor - which is exactly what the N.3 note
      above warns a constant becomes. A column that can only ever be None is
      worse than no column.
v4.2  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).


Structured event journal for every decision and refusal.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

analysis/signal_journal.py — signal-time instrumentation (LOG-ONLY, never trades).
N.7: every row carries `ruleset`, the short commit this
        It stamped every event with only the INTEGRATED label and conviction,
        and both are measured dead as entry-side quantities (RGCV.nf 1.00 vs
        .ok 0.34 in RANGING - an ANTI-signal; 1.00 vs 1.00 in trend).
        The RAW direction axis SEPARATES: nf 0.628 -> ok 0.885, gap +0.257,
        n=753 / 17 sessions (P0.1) - up from AX.2's +0.188 on n=571, so it GREW
        score separates where the INTEGRATED conviction does not."
        IT WAS JOURNALED NOWHERE - decompose() was a pure function main never
        called. LOG-ONLY: gates nothing, sizes nothing.
        `volatility_conf` rides along (AX.2: +0.065, never tested by P0.1
        because it was not emitted). `pair_conf` is NOT emitted - measured dead
        and structurally so.
        process is running. Resolved ONCE at import — a `git rev-parse` per
        journal line would put a subprocess in the trading loop, and a process
        runs one ruleset for its whole life anyway.
        WHY: every cross-date analysis of these rows has been pooling decisions
        from different engines with no way to say so. L3.2a could only emit
        `decision_hash: null`; the same gap was named on 07-29 about engine
        identity. Falls back to "unknown" rather than a partial hash — a wrong
        hash is worse than an absent one because it looks attributable.
        Log-only, no trading behaviour touched.
N.2 + N.3: signal_ctx now carries `rrr` (reward:risk from the
        underlying levels, None when levels are absent — NOT 0.0, since "no stop"
        and "worst possible trade" must stay distinguishable), plus sweep-only
        `closes_beyond` and `sweep_age_bars`. These are FACTOR COLUMNS: they
        cannot be backfilled, so every session without them is a session of
        conditional data that will never exist. rrr in particular is what makes
        item F's MIN_RRR floor calibratable from its own rejections rather than
        vetoing invisibly.
initial release.
WHY THIS EXISTS (ROADMAP Phase 3.1, verbatim):
    "Instrument first. Log at signal time, for EVERY signal (fired AND
     fees estimate, and eventual outcome for fired ones. A gate you can't
     counterfactual is a gate you can't calibrate."
The 1-min OHLC tape is replayable forever; what is NOT reconstructible after
16:00 is what the option chain looked like at signal time — premium, bid/ask
spread, IV, greeks — and which gate disposed of the signal. This module makes
that perishable context durable. Without it, every session between now and the
Phase-3 calibration campaign is tape that can never become calibration data.
DESIGN RULES (non-negotiable):
  1. This module can NEVER crash the trading loop. Every public function
     swallows every exception (logged at DEBUG). A full disk, a bad payload,
     a permissions error — all degrade to "no journal line", never to a raised
     exception. The bot's behavior with this module present is byte-identical
     to its behavior with the module deleted.
  2. LOG-ONLY. Imports nothing from execution/, risk/, strategy/,
     notifications/. Holds no state beyond an open-file cache. Never reads
     trades.db, never touches the store.
  3. Append-only JSONL, one line per event:
         data/signal_journal/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<SYMBOL>.jsonl
     Self-locates the repo root (mirrors shadow/observer.py) — no /var/lib,
     no per-box path. Collected off-box by snapshot.sh / harvest like the
     other data/ products (add to the EOD chain when the volume justifies it).
EVENT VOCABULARY (the offline bucketer keys on `event`):
  scored        — emitted by risk/setup_scorer.score() for EVERY scored
                  signal, including below-B rejections (grade="REJECT").
                  Carries the full breakdown, thresholds, quote context.
  disposition   — emitted by main.attempt_new_entry for what happened AFTER
                  scoring: fired | sizing_rejected | invalid_signal.
                  Carries ORB retest_depth when the signal is an ORB.
  retest_check  — emitted by orb_engine._check_for_retest for every 1-min
                  candle examined while ARMED (defect G): the penetration
                  depth distribution INCLUDING near-misses (negative depth =
                  wick never entered the range). Raw px + orb_width; divide
                  by tape ATR offline (ATR-relative per defect G, never a
                  percentage).
Joining scored -> disposition -> trades.db outcome: events within the same
second for the same symbol/strategy are the same signal (the loop is
single-threaded per box; one signal per tick). `ts_et` is the join key.
