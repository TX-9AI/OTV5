analysis/chain_snapshot.py  v4.1
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Archives the full option chain per snapshot to disk.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

analysis/chain_snapshot.py — full option-chain archival (LOG-ONLY, never trades).
initial release.
WHY THIS EXISTS
    The bot already fetches the COMPLETE 0DTE chain every ~15s tick — bid, ask,
    mark, delta, gamma, theta, vega, IV, open interest and volume for every
    strike. Roughly 23,000 full-chain snapshots per fleet-day. Until this
    module, 100% of it was discarded except the single contract that happened
    to be selected, serialized into the signal_journal `scored` event — and
    even that dropped gamma and vega.
    Option chains are NOT reconstructible after the session. Unlike the 1-min
    OHLC tape (replayable forever) or swing pivots (deterministic from tape),
    a quote for a strike nobody selected is gone permanently at 16:00. There is
    no vendor, no backfill, no replay that recovers it.
    That makes every un-archived session a permanent hole in the dataset for:
      * ANY future strike-selection rule, tested retroactively instead of live
        (pitchfork rail-anchored strikes, liquidity-ranked, delta-based,
        VWAP-anchored on the names where VWAP works)
      * the IV surface and skew through the day
      * real bid/ask width by strike and hour — the noise band that trips a
        premium-relative stop
      * empirical theta decay and delta drift on 0DTE
      * the inputs to our own GEX calculation, currently computed then thrown
        away
DESIGN RULES (inherited verbatim from signal_journal.py — non-negotiable):
  1. This module can NEVER crash the trading loop. Every public function
     swallows every exception (logged at DEBUG). A full disk, a bad payload, a
     permissions error — all degrade to "no snapshot", never to a raised
     exception. The bot's behavior with this module present is byte-identical
     to its behavior with the module deleted.
  2. LOG-ONLY. Imports nothing from execution/, risk/, strategy/,
     notifications/. Gates nothing, scores nothing, reads no DB.
  3. NO EXTRA MARKET-DATA LOAD. It serializes an OptionsChain object the
     caller ALREADY has in hand. No fetch, no API call, no DXFeed subscription.
  4. Append-only gzipped JSONL, one line per snapshot:
         data/chain_snapshots/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<SYMBOL>.jsonl.gz
     Written with gzip mode "ab" — each line is its own gzip member, which is
     valid multi-member gzip and reads back transparently via gzip.open(),
     `zcat`, or pandas. Append-safe across restarts; no rewrite, no temp file.
CADENCE
    Default 5 minutes (OT_CHAIN_SNAPSHOT_MIN). Rationale: every-tick archival
    is ~28 MB/box/day (~420 MB/day fleet-wide) which is not worth it, while
    5-minute is ~1.4 MB/box/day (~21 MB/day fleet, ~40 MB/month gzipped) and
    still resolves any intraday question we have posed. Set to 0 to disable.
    The cadence is wall-clock aligned, not tick-aligned: a snapshot fires on
    the first tick at or after each 5-minute boundary. Restarts therefore do
    not shift the grid, and two boxes are directly comparable.
