analysis/trade_readiness.py  v4.6
v4.6  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r229 (EM.2) — _expected_move_now returns the tastytrade platform's expected move (volatility_measures.expected_move_platform), 0.0 when unreadable; the operator's ruling 2026-10-03. Log-only engine; its `em` unit is ~10-25% smaller from this revision on - do not pool across it.
v4.5  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r223 (EM.1) — _expected_move_now delegates to analysis.volatility_measures.straddle_nearest (moved verbatim).
v4.4  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r77 — the dead `sweep_reversal_strategy` import
      is gone. That module was deleted at r33; the import has raised ever since,
      been swallowed, and `target = 0.20` has been the real behaviour. NO
      behaviour change — the constant is what already ran.
v4.3  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r12 (HYG.1) — `_combine` and `momentum_val` dedented out of
      ramp(): they were nested and unreachable; every readiness path raised NameError
      behind the import guard. Predecessor defect #8; ports as a fix.
v4.2  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).


v4.1  2026-08-21  PHASE B (r58): every label arm rebuilt on MEASURED inputs or
      made honestly constant. The arms all took else on every tick since the
      split (labels are never computed), so R was silently wrong exactly as the
      Phase B handoff records. Direction now reads the trend vote (descriptive
      feed; this module gates nothing), sweep-ness reads the liquidity map, and
      ranging/coil are 0.0 with the structural replacements named as owed.
Pre-trigger confluence logging and arming state.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

# analysis/trade_readiness.py — options_trader_v3 — v1.9
# SWP.3: the sweep APPROACH corroborator's sign is
#         refuted (LIQ.1 + ANT.1 + ANT.2, three independent lines), weight
#         -> 0.0 and the remaining three renormalised 0.30/0.20/0.25 ->
#         0.400/0.267/0.333 so the ABSOLUTE stage/arm bars keep their meaning.
#         Not inverted: `1 - appr_val` would assert 'far from a level = ready',
#         nonsense for a sweep. Sign wrong, form unknown — so the term is
#         removed from the composite and KEPT in the journal.
#         LOG-ONLY: main.py:2045 discards assess_all()'s return, so no trade
#         changes today. It stops every FUTURE fit against the readiness
#         composite inheriting a term measured to point backwards.
# BFLY.1: THE BUTTERFLY TRACK WAS SCORING A DIFFERENT TRADE.
#         The strategy is a GEX-PIN play — Gate 5 hard-refuses unless
#         `gex_environment == "PINNING"`, the tent is centred on `pin_strike`
#         (not ATM), and the thesis is to enter CHEAP while price is still a walk
#         away and let it migrate into the tent. The readiness track graded
#         `coil` (the COMPRESSION label) as a HARD VETO plus a boolean squeeze
#         and band width — a COMPRESSION play. **Not one of the five gates that
#         actually block the strategy was in it**: no pin, no pin distance, no
#         GEX environment, no entry window, no one-per-session.
#         MEASURED 2026-08-10: **would_fire=2132 against ONE trade**, R p50 0.995
#         / p90 1.000. The thing it measured was ready all day; the thing that
#         has to be true almost never was. A label switch wearing the name of a
#         pin play — and it renders as a perfectly healthy 1.0.
#         NOW: `pin_val` (distance to the pin in EXPECTED-MOVE units — the
#         operator's "still a walk away", made numeric, and the same unit the
#         strategy's own proximity gate uses), `firm_val` (|net_gex|, so a 2.3M
#         pin outranks a 0.1M one — the strategy's PINNING flag is binary and
#         cannot), `win_val` (ramps UP toward the 12:00 window rather than
#         switching on at it, because readiness exists to ARM AHEAD, and goes to
#         ZERO after 14:00 when the strategy cannot fire at all), and `gex_val`
#         as a SOFT-NECESSARY (PINNING 1.0 / NEUTRAL 0.35 / TRENDING 0.10) so a
#         non-pinning tape scores a fraction rather than nothing — that is the
#         difference between "not yet" and "never", which a boolean cannot say.
#         `coil` survives DEMOTED to a corroborator: a coiling tape is supporting
#         evidence for a pin holding, it was never the trade.
#         OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR: 0.115 far/NEUTRAL/weak → 0.342 mid/PINNING/weak →
#         0.930 near/PINNING/firm; 0.093 on a TRENDING tape with identical pin
#         geometry; 0.155 warming at 10:45; 0.000 once the window shuts.
#         ⚠️ LOG-ONLY. Nothing gates on readiness — this changes what the score
#         SAYS, not what fires. Promotion was already solved by CNT.6 removing
#         ⚠️ PIN DISTANCE FALLS BACK TO ATR when no chain is on ctx, because
#         expected move needs one and a chainless tick must not silently zero
#         the term carrying the whole thesis. `pin_dist_unit` records WHICH unit
#         was used — em and atr2 are different scales and must NEVER be pooled
#         when fitting the bounds.
# SWEEP APPROACH, and the removal of a veto that had gone
#         DEAD UNDER OUR OWN FIX. `_sweep` carried `hard_vetoes=[is_sweep]`,
#         requiring the committed label to BE SWEEP_REVERSAL. RGM.3 (baked
#         2026-08-08) took SWEEP out of the argmax, so that label is never
#         emitted and this track has scored a PERMANENT ZERO since — the same
#         category error as the dispatch gate, one layer down, created two days
#         earlier by the fix that was meant to free sweep. Readiness ARMS a
#         track BEFORE its event; gating it on the event's own label made arming
#         impossible by construction, and any new factor would have multiplied
#         into a hard zero and changed nothing.
#         NEW `appr_val` — conviction rises as price nears a named pool, scaled
#         by how well that level has held. Operator's spec: distance as PRICE
#         DELTA NORMALISED BY ATR, so 0.20 is imminent on GLD and noise on NVDA.
#         Proximity and level quality MULTIPLY: close to an untested level is
#         not the setup, and neither is a well-tested level far away.
#         ⚠️ BOUNDS ARE FITTED, NOT GUESSED. Shadow observer (BACKLOG v4.05):
#         only 14.0% of observations sit within 0.5 ATR of a named level, MEDIAN
#         2.32 ATR. My first draft used 0.15/1.20, which put the MEDIAN TICK at
#         zero proximity and would have left the factor dead across roughly
#         three-quarters of the session. I had the direction of that error
#         backwards until I read a distribution that was already on file.
#         ⚠️ LONDON IS A BONUS (1.15), NOT A MULTIPLIER. Named levels are 61.3%
#         London High/Low, and there is a mechanism — London runs to 16:00 UTC,
#         so it is the only named level still FORMING during RTH, which is also
#         why it accrues few touches and would be UNDER-scored by touch_count
#         alone. But 61.3% is a frequency of PROXIMITY, not of profitability: a
#         level you are always near because it brackets the range is not a
#         magnetic one. Weighted modestly so Friday's SHD.2 re-pull can back it
#         out with a knob rather than a redesign.
#         `appr_name` now lands on every readiness record, so "which levels get
#         swept" becomes answerable from data instead of from recollection.
# `dir` ON EVERY TRACK (log-only, no behaviour change).
#         Until now exactly ONE track journaled a direction: _trend_credit_spread
#         emitted `factors.dir` and the other five emitted nothing. That was
#         invisible until the VWAP orientation ledger ran against it and 30,565
#         records landed in a single "undecidable" bucket whose LABEL blamed the
#         cash-index case — five of six strategies were being discarded for a
#         missing field, under a caption that said something else entirely.
#         Each track now stamps `dir` from the source that actually knows:
#         continuation from the trending label (identical to `_staged_pick`'s
#         derivation, so the two can never disagree); sweep from the LIVE
#         `liq_map.recent_sweep.kind`, which no offline tool could ever recover;
#         condor sides from EXPOSURE — a call credit is SHORT, the inverse of
#         the option-buyer reading, and `side` is kept alongside because the two
#         answer different questions; butterfly explicitly "neutral".
#         "" means NO INTENDED SIDE THIS TICK and is an honest absence — the
#         whole point is that a reader can now tell "sideless by design" from
#         "field never existed", which is the distinction whose absence cost the
#         ledger five versions.
#         ⚠️ FORWARD-ONLY. This changes what gets WRITTEN, so it reaches only
#         sessions after the bake. Every already-banked session is still read by
#         `vwap_orientation_ledger` v1.4's derivation, which is why that
#         derivation is kept rather than replaced.
# MARKET SNAPSHOT ON EVERY READINESS RECORD (backfilled into
#         this changelog on 2026-08-08 — it shipped without one, and the title
#         line carried no version at all while check_versions already pinned
#         "v1.5". Exactly the drift WORKING_AGREEMENT rule 5 exists to stop, and
#         it is recorded rather than quietly corrected). `_market_snapshot`
#         emits {vwap, price_vs_vwap, dist_pct} into `readiness.market` on every
#         record. volatility_engine had computed vwap and price_vs_vwap all
#         along and NOTHING PERSISTED THEM: a key scan of 11,138 records found
#         no VWAP-shaped field anywhere, which is why `vwap_orientation` had
#         never once run. `dist_pct` is signed and expressed as a percentage of
#         VWAP so it compares across a $30 symbol and a $900 one;
#         `price_vs_vwap` is carried rather than derived from its sign, because
#         the engine reports NONE on zero volume and a computed sign would
#         invent an orientation there.
# ARM-ORIGIN EXTENSION (operator spec). The "move" is
#         defined to START when confluence ARMS: ReadinessState now stamps
#         (origin_price, origin_em, origin_ts) at every STAGING->ARMED
#         transition, RE-STAMPS on every re-arm (flicker/disarm then re-arm =
#         fresh origin), and clears on disarm. `_extension_from_arm` scores the
#         fraction of the arm-EM consumed since; a short-premium vertical is
#         "premium rich" at TR_EXT_FIRE_FRAC (0.80) of that EM. Wired as the
#         shared W_VERT_EXT corroborator into BOTH the condor sides (range
#         adapter, per-side up/down) and the trend credit spread (trend adapter)
#         `_expected_move_now` derives EM from the ATM straddle on ctx["chain"].
#         Bounds OT_TR_EXT_* / OT_TR_W_VERT_* overridable. 0.80 is a PRIOR — the
#         point of shipping live+logged is to discover the right number.
# TREND CREDIT SPREAD readiness track (TC.4, LOG-ONLY). New
#         `_trend_credit_spread` track: readiness for a short-premium trend-
#         participation trade (PCS in TRENDING_BULL, CCS in TRENDING_BEAR) that
#         needs no pullback and no chase — sell a spread BEYOND the impulse
#         candle that ripped. Impulse = a 1-min candle whose range in rolling-SD
#         units clears the operator's aware/established/screaming ramp
#         (1.75/2.0/2.5 SD, OT_TR_TCS_* overridable, ALL PRIOR — calibrate from
#         the journal, never one day). The impulse candle does double duty:
#         magnitude (SD) feeds conviction; extreme (low/high) anchors the short
#         strike (committed flow won't fully retrace — durable floor/ceiling).
#         Corroborators: impulse, conviction, structural room to the floor,
#         momentum-live. Damper: parabolic over-extension (snapback risk). Hard
#         veto: trending label in the correct direction. Smoke-tested: impulse
#         ramp drives R aware->established->screaming; RANGING vetoes to 0;
#         5-ATR parabolic damps to 0. GATES NOTHING (freeze-safe). The FIRING
#         engine (vertical_spread_strategy.py) is a SEPARATE later file, gated
#         on digest-calibrated bounds + the L1 excavation — see ROADMAP TC.4.
# ALL FACTOR BOUNDS ENV-OVERRIDABLE (OT_TR_*). v1.0/v1.1
#         env-ified only the STATE-MACHINE bars and left every FACTOR ramp as
#         a hardcoded literal — inconsistent with L1, where all 14 ramp bounds
#         are OT_RC_* overridable, and that property is exactly what let the
#         room_s refit be trialled on one box with instant rollback instead of
#         a fleet redeploy. First live day (2026-07-28) proved the cost: the
#         conviction ramp topped out at 0.65 while fleet L2 conviction ran
#         0.59-0.83, so conv_val pegged at 1.0 on roughly half the boxes and
#         ten symbols reported an identical r=0.65. Correcting that guess
#         should be an env flip, not a bake. Now: 13 factor bounds + 8
#         categorical momentum weights are OT_TR_*.
#         DEFAULTS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED. The pegged bound is NOT re-guessed
#         here — every readiness row already journals the RAW conv/approach/
#         distance alongside the ramped value, so the digest (v1.1) fits the
#         bounds from the observed distribution the way room_s was fitted.
#         Guessing a second time is the error this whole workstream exists to
#         stop. Pegging does not corrupt the fit: the raw inputs are logged
#         un-ramped, and nothing gates on R.
# STAGED PICKS (still LOG-ONLY). While a directional
#         strategy (continuation, sweep) is ARMED and a chain is on ctx, the
#         engine now computes the contract it WOULD select — through the SAME
#         selector the live entry uses (options_chain.select_sweep_strike) —
#         using a SMOOTHED conviction (wall-clock EMA, same half-life idiom as
#         slope) instead of the instantaneous spike, and journals it as
#         `readiness_staged_pick` (throttled to the heartbeat cadence + always
#         beside would_fire). When the real trigger later fires, the journal
#         holds staged-pick rows next to the trigger-tick pick, so the chain
#         archive can answer IN DOLLARS whether calm selection beats spike
#         selection — before staged picks ever touch an order. The PLTR strike
#         (0.62 spike -> 0.16 delta -> unreachable) is the failure class this
#         measures. Condor/butterfly staged ladders deferred (multi-leg).
# NEW FILE. Trade-trigger READINESS engine (LOG-ONLY).
#   graded evidence. This module applies the same thinking one layer up, to the
#   TRADE TRIGGERS: each strategy's pre-trigger confluence becomes a graded
#   readiness R in [0,1] evaluated every ~15s tick, with a dt-aware SLOPE so
#   the system can tell whether a trade's confluence is RISING or FALLING, and
#   an arming state machine (DORMANT -> STAGING -> ARMED -> would_fire) that
#   anticipates when a trade will be ready to fire.
#   Operator's framing (2026-07-27): assessment of what the market is doing in
#   the context of where it IS right now, where it's BEEN, and where the
#   lowest-timeframe signals suggest it is HEADING.
#     - now:     instantaneous strategy-local geometry + L1-derived state
#     - been:    the L2 committed conviction (persistence lives in Layer 2)
#     - heading: EMA'd dR/dt on the 15-second tick cadence
#   The last gate is binary regardless — that is the nature of a trigger. This
#   module's job is to make that bit the LAST place information collapses, not
#   the first: everything upstream stays graded, journaled, and visible.
#   LOG-ONLY BY DESIGN (pitchfork weight-0 precedent): this engine gates
#   NOTHING and changes NO fire decision. It observes and journals. It runs
#   inside the frozen-baseline window precisely because it cannot move a label
#   or a trade; its journal rows are the calibration data for the bars that
#   will eventually gate. It does not validate the Layer-1 data — it gives
#   clues about what the Layer-1 data believes, per tick, per strategy.
#   LAYER BOUNDARY: this is L3/strategy-level. Referencing tradability context
#   states; it writes nothing back. L1 stays instantaneous and frozen.
#   TICK-VS-BAR RULE (July-20 audit): all temporal math is WALL-CLOCK dt-aware.
#   No per-evaluate counters anywhere in this file — the 15s loop can call
#   assess() at any cadence, including the 4x-duplicated-candle case that
#   inflated bars_since_break.
#   RESTART: state is in-memory and resets on restart. Acceptable for a
#   log-only observer — a restart shows up in the journal as a DORMANT reset,
#   which is itself useful evidence.
#   ORB IS EXEMPT (standing directive): the ORB is intentionally mechanical
#   and already has its own arming machine + retest_check journaling.

# ANT.1 (appr_val -41%, appr_touches -45% against outcome) and ANT.2 (fitted

# WHY NOT JUST INVERT IT. `1 - appr_val` asserts "far from any named level =
# ready", which is nonsense for a SWEEP — the trade is penetration and rejection
# AT a level. The likelier mechanism is that PROXIMITY IS PRE-SWEEP: price near a
# pool means the sweep has not happened yet, so the term was scoring the setup's
# ABSENCE. We know the sign is wrong and we do NOT know the right functional

        WHY IT IS HERE. `volatility_engine` has computed `vwap` and
        `price_vs_vwap` all along and NOTHING PERSISTED THEM. A key scan of
        2026-08-05's journal — 11,138 records, every event type — found no
        VWAP-shaped field anywhere, which is why `vwap_orientation` has never
        once run. It is not a broken tool; it was built against a schema that
        never landed.
        WHY IT MATTERS NOW: item AI's candidate fix for the condor is a
        VWAP-ANCHORED midpoint instead of the flat Bollinger midline. That
        cannot be evaluated on data that does not exist, so every session
        between now and the decision is history we either have or do not — the
        same use-it-or-lose-it logic as the candle tape.
        `dist_pct` is SIGNED and expressed as a percentage of VWAP, so it is
        comparable across a $30 symbol and a $900 one. `price_vs_vwap` is
        carried alongside rather than derived from it, because the engine sets
        NONE when there is no volume and a computed sign would silently invent
        an orientation there.
        Log-only. Returns {} rather than raising: this must never reach the
        trading loop.
