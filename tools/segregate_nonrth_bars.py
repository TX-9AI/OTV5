tools/segregate_nonrth_bars.py — move the 24-hour contamination. v1.0
v1.0 — 2026-08-20 — INITIAL. Companion to candle_feed v3.17.

⚠️ THIS MOVES, IT DOES NOT DELETE — and that distinction was nearly missed.
`EXT_INTERVAL` is **1h only**, so for 5m/15m/1m there is no extended stream at
all: an overnight bar written by the contaminated backfill is the ONLY copy
that will ever exist, and DXFeed history is use-it-or-lose-it. Deleting to
protect the RTH series would have traded one irreversible loss for another.
Non-RTH rows are re-symboled to `<SYM>_EXT`, which already means "this stream
carries overnight". The RTH series becomes pure again for the consumers built
to read it — structure_analyzer's swings and S/R at weight 2.0, the
pitchfork's 1h fractals, trend_engine's 0.20 context vote, entry_snapshot —
and every bar stays queryable.

WHY THIS EXISTS. After the FEED.2 route collision was fixed (v3.16), the
restart's backfill asked DXFeed for plain-symbol history and got 24-HOUR bars
back — roughly 12 bars/hour overnight against 38–39 in RTH, reaching about 15
days back (the 2026-08-05 boundary). v3.17 stops any MORE arriving. This
removes what already landed.

⚠️ WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL HOLE. A gap announces itself; this
does not. The series CHANGES CHARACTER MID-STREAM — 07-31 is RTH-only, 08-19
is 24-hour — with nothing marking the seam. Anything reading higher-timeframe
structure across it (swings, S/R, the hourly pitchfork) is reading a
discontinuity it cannot detect. Every day this waits is another day of
analysis built on a mixed series.

THE CONTROL THAT PROVES IT IS REAL: SPX shows only hours 13–20 UTC. An index
has no overnight session, so it had nothing to contaminate — which rules out a
timezone or DST artifact and confirms genuine extended-hours data on the
equities.

SAFETY, because this DELETES:
  · DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. `--apply` is required to write anything.
  · `*_EXT` symbols are NEVER touched. Carrying overnight is their purpose.
  · 1d and coarser are NEVER touched. A daily bar is stamped at midnight and
    would fail every intraday test — deleting the daily series is one line
    away and would stay invisible until something asked for a daily level.
  · Weekends and holidays are removed only for INTRADAY intervals.
  · A backup copy of the DB is taken before the first write unless
    `--no-backup` is passed.
  · Rows that would COLLIDE with an existing `<SYM>_EXT` bar at the same
    timestamp are reported, not silently merged — if the two disagree that is
    worth seeing before either is trusted.
  · Reports per (symbol, interval): rows kept, rows to delete, the resulting
    oldest/newest, and the DATE RANGE affected — so the blast radius is
    visible before it happens, not after.

Run on a BOX (never control — the feed_store lives on the boxes):
  cd ~/options-trader && python3 tools/segregate_nonrth_bars.py          # dry run
  cd ~/options-trader && python3 tools/segregate_nonrth_bars.py --apply
