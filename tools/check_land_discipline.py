#!/usr/bin/env python3
# tools/check_land_discipline.py — v1.2
# v1.2 (2026-09-08) — OTV4TEST r1. `--ledger <path>` selects the revision ledger
#   whose row is verified. Defaults to docs/GENESIS.md, so every existing caller
#   is unchanged; the fork passes docs/GENESIS-TEST.md.
#   🔴 TWO COPIES NOW EXIST — this one in OTV4TEST, one in day_trader_pro. The
#   fork box cannot reach control, so it must carry its own. They are identical
#   as shipped and dtp needs the same v1.2 landed or they drift.
# v1.1
# v1.1 (2026-08-30) — otv4 r194 / dtp r232. GENESIS ROWS MAY NOT CONTAIN A BARE
#   HTML TAG. Operator: "something broke & the new additions are nesting now."
#   🔴 TWO ROWS CONTAINED THE LITERAL STRING <table> — r184's
#   raw/derived_<table>/ and r191's raw/<table>/dt=/sym=/. GitHub renders raw
#   HTML inside table cells, so each one OPENED AN HTML TABLE that never
#   closed: r184 swallowed r185-r191, and r191 swallowed r192. The ledger's
#   own rows became children of the rows above them.
#   🔑 BOTH WERE MINE AND THE PROSE WAS CORRECT. Angle-bracket placeholders
#   are this project's idiom — <date>, <SYM>, <prefix>, <Strategy>. Only
#   SOME of them collide with a real element name, so the failure is
#   invisible in the source and shows only on the rendered page, which nobody
#   re-reads after landing.
#   ⚠️ THE SCAN COVERS EVERY ROW AND RUNS EVEN IN HOOK MODE. A ledger that is
#   already broken stays broken silently otherwise, and the row's own number
#   is not needed to see that the PAGE is malformed.
#   ⚠️ NON-HTML PLACEHOLDERS STAY LEGAL. Flagging <date> would make this cry
#   wolf on the repo's own idiom, and a check that cries wolf trains you to
#   skip red runs. Only names GitHub actually renders are refused; the fix is
#   a backtick.
# v1.0 (2026-08-29) — r183. Operator's instruction after r182 landed: "when
#   you're landing files, have a check that the Genesis line is added, the
#   write map is updated and the file map is updated ... Also check that each
#   file's versioning and changelog are being bumped each time."
#
#   ONE TOOL, BOTH REPOS. It lives here because day_trader_pro is the control
#   repo, is always present on control, and — unlike options-trader-v4 — has
#   NO land gate of its own, so its version headers have never been checked by
#   anything. Pointing one implementation at both beats two that drift.
#
#   ⚠️ IT DETECTS CAPABILITY, IT DOES NOT ASSUME IT. otv4 carries GENESIS.md,
#   FILE_MAP.md and WRITE_MAP.md; dtp carries none of the three. A checker that
#   demanded all three everywhere would fail dtp on every run for a reason that
#   is not a defect — the CV.1 failure, where a check that cries wolf trains
#   the reader to skip red runs. Absent artifact => that check reports SKIP and
#   says so by name. "Not applicable" and "passed" must never look alike.
#
# 🔴 THE CHECK THIS EXISTS FOR IS D (BUMP), AND IT IS THE ONE NOTHING COVERED.
#   The repo's standing rule since 2026-07-23 is that the version lives in TWO
#   places — the TITLE line and the newest dated CHANGELOG entry — and that the
#   two must agree. Both drifts have been seen for real: title lines stale
#   across the whole dtp repo while changelogs advanced, and the devtools
#   banner reading v1.14 against a v1.19 header. Nothing has ever verified it.
#
# ⚠️ A HEADER BUMP WITH NO EDIT IS NOT WHAT THIS PROVES, AND IT MUST NOT CLAIM
#   TO. This asserts the version MOVED and that a dated entry describes it. It
#   cannot tell whether the entry is TRUE. The land command's own content gate
#   (a positive grep for a distinctive line from the real change, plus a
#   negative grep that the superseded code is gone) is what proves the edit
#   happened; this proves the bookkeeping did. Two different claims — running
#   this one and calling the delivery verified would be exactly the laundered
#   green WORKING_AGREEMENT §18 warns about.
