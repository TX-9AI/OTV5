execution/tick_size.py  v4.1
v4.1  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r216 (HYG.14) — docstring only: the reference to the deleted fill_model is removed.
Venue tick-size rules per symbol and price band.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/tick_size.py — options_trader_v3 — (FRC.3)
THE VENUE'S PRICE GRID — ONE RESOLVER, USED BY EVERY ORDER PATH.
Operator: *"some contracts allow one cent increments others are five cents and
even a few other are $.10"* and *"that should extend to all orders
unambiguously."*
An unpostable limit is not a rounding nit. The venue either REJECTS it — the
order never exists and the setup passes — or SILENTLY ADJUSTS it, which is a
fill at a price nobody chose, with nothing in our logs to explain the
difference. The second is worse, because it looks like it worked.
⚠️ THIS REPLACED A GUESS. The first version keyed off a hardcoded
`PENNY_CLASSES` set. Membership of the Penny Interval Program is a BROKER/OCC
fact that changes over time and is not derivable from anything on this box, so
that list was flagged unverified the day it was written. The venue publishes the
real rule; this reads it.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RESOLUTION ORDER — and the point is that ORDER TIME NEVER GUESSES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. VENUE RULE — `NestedOptionChain.tick_sizes`, a list of
     `TickSize(value, threshold, symbol)`. `threshold` expresses the $3.00
     boundary GENERICALLY, so nothing here hardcodes 3.00 or assumes a single
     breakpoint. Static instrument metadata, so it is fetched once per symbol
     per session and cached.
  2. QUOTE PROOF — a bid of 2.13 PROVES a penny grid. ASYMMETRIC: an off-nickel
     price proves penny, but an on-nickel price proves nothing (0.05 is a
     multiple of 0.01). So this can only ever REFINE downward, never coarsen.
     Free, and a live cross-check on the cached rule.
  3. FALLBACK LIST — `config.PENNY_CLASSES`, last resort, and it LOGS when
     reached so "how often are we still guessing" is a number rather than an
     assumption.
EVERY RESOLUTION CARRIES ITS SOURCE. If a fill ever returns at a price we did
not post, the log must say whether we priced off the venue rule, an inference,
or the guess — otherwise the silent-adjustment failure is undiagnosable.
UNKNOWN STAYS COARSE. No rule and no proof means the widest plausible increment:
a valid price at a slightly worse level beats a rejected or silently adjusted
one.
