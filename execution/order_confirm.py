execution/order_confirm.py  v5.0
v5.0  2026-10-25  OTV5 r7 (SPLIT.1) — HEADER RESET AT THE LINEAGE SPLIT. Every entry below this line is the predecessor's history (cited by its own prefix); from here each change to this file counts v5.1, v5.2, ...
v4.3  2026-10-18  OTV4TEST r295 (LIVE.2) — confirm_order_fill touches the heartbeat on every broker poll
      (utils.heartbeat.touch). Audit 2026-10-18 C2.
v4.2  2026-10-04  r464 / B0 (OTV4TEST r242 mirror of otv4 r463 c912ce7, verbatim) — every Account call goes through tasty_client.sdk_result: on tastytrade
      13.x (the boxes run 13.0.0) Account methods are COROUTINES, and called bare
      a LIVE box could place and close nothing. Paper unaffected. Found by
      OTV4TEST (MSG-1004-06). Pinned by tests/check_sdk_async.py.
v4.1  2026-08-24  r104: confirm_order_fill takes an optional per-call
      deadline_s so the entry ladder can give ONE RUNG a slice of the entry
      budget. Default unchanged.
Order acknowledgement and fill confirmation.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/order_confirm.py — LIVE entry-order fill confirmation (audit defect O).
initial. The ENTRY-side mirror of exit_engine v3.5's
        fill-confirmation: submit is NOT a fill, and a position may be recorded
        ONLY at the broker's actual per-leg net fill price, for the quantity
        that actually filled.
        Entry semantics differ from exits in one deliberate way: an exit MUST
        eventually happen (the caller retries and escalates), but an entry is
        OPTIONAL — if the order doesn't fill by the deadline we CANCEL and walk
        away; the strategy re-evaluates on a later tick with fresh marks.
        There is no cross-tick resume for entries. The one thing we never do is
        walk away from contracts that DID fill: a partial entry is booked at
        its weighted net price for the filled quantity (it is a real position
        and must be managed), and the unfilled remainder is cancelled.
        Safety net: if the cancel itself fails and the order is still working
        after retries, we return unfilled with the order id and page — anything
        that fills afterward is picked up by broker reconciliation's ADOPT path
        (which exists precisely for broker positions with no DB plan).
Used by: main._execute_condor_leg (v3.7). Built to be reused by
entry_engine's single-leg and butterfly paths and condor_roll's rolled
vertical (audit defects O-remainder and P).
