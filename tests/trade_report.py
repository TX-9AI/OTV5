# tests/trade_report.py — v1.24
# v1.24 (2026-09-26) — OTV4TEST r160. EXIT REASON — DOLLARS IS RANKED BY NET $, best first (was by N).
#   Operator: "For Exit Reason - Dollars, can you rank them by net?" The table's rendering moves into
#   show_exit_dollars() so the order is testable (check_trade_report T13); a reason with no P&L sorts
#   last, N breaks ties.
# v1.23 (2026-09-26) — OTV4TEST r159. THE EXIT-REASON TABLE IS IN DOLLARS. The operator: "I don't
#   know what that share column is for or what I would do with that information. I'd rather see the
#   dollar amounts of the actual exits. And I would rather see the MFE/MAE in dollar amounts." SESS,
#   TOP DATE and SHARE are gone; per exit reason the table now shows N, NET $ (total P&L of the trades
#   that exited that way), AVG $ (mean exit P&L per trade), and MFE $ / MAE $ (mean best / worst OPEN
#   P&L per trade: (max|min_premium_seen - entry) x contracts x 100). Whole dollars, to fit 76. The
#   1-DAY flag (>=80% of a reason's trades on one date, n >= --min-n) stays as a tag. Sorted by N.
# v1.22 (2026-09-26) — OTV4TEST r158. THE EXIT-REASON TABLE GAINS MFE% / MAE%, AND THE "thin" LABELS
#   GO. The operator, 2026-09-26: "Exit reason does not have any MFE/MAE — I don't need the report
#   pointing out that a sample size of 1 is 'thin' — no shit." EXIT REASON x SESSION SPREAD now shows,
#   per exit reason, the MEDIAN MFE% (best premium seen vs entry, `max_premium_seen`) and MAE% (worst,
#   `min_premium_seen`) over ALL its trades — the same fields and formula EXIT BEHAVIOUR uses, so the
#   two agree. `<- thin` is removed from that table (r294's reasoning again: at this sample nearly
#   every row tripped it, so it marked the ordinary case), and the per-row `thin` in the outliers
#   section goes too; the RULE stays (a bucket under --min-n is kept whole, stated once below the
#   section), because the flag was display and the rule is a guard. To fit 76 columns the
#   `<- SINGLE-SESSION` flag is `1-DAY`, defined in the note under the table.
# v1.21 (2026-09-26) — OTV4TEST r157. ONE MORE EV SECTION: BY SETUP TYPE, OUTLIERS REMOVED, BOTH
#   TAILS. Operator: "Can you add one more EV section to that report that removes statistical
#   outliers? Good & bad?" — asked after one +19.63R VOLT trade turned out to carry VOLT's whole
#   +0.59 EV (without it, -0.14). THE RULE IS FIXED, NOT TUNED: Tukey's fences, 1.5 x IQR beyond the
#   quartiles of R, computed ONCE over the whole book in the window (a bucket of 4 has no quartiles
#   of its own), applied to both tails. Each row shows how many trades each tail lost (OUT+ / OUT-),
#   EV R on all trades, EV R on the rest, and the rest's net. ⚠️ On this book the LOW fence removes
#   nothing — stops cap losses near -1R to -2R, so no loser is a statistical outlier; the section
#   says which tails actually lost trades rather than implying symmetry. Sorted by the trimmed EV.
#   🔑 THIN BUCKETS ARE NOT TRIMMED. Operator: "In thin samples consider them all within the
#   sample." A bucket under --min-n trades (8) keeps every trade — its EV ex equals its EV R and
#   the row says `thin` — because cutting one trade from three is not removing an outlier, it is
#   deleting a third of the evidence. The fence counts in the header cover trimmed buckets only.
# v1.20 (2026-09-26) — OTV4TEST r156. EVERY LINE FITS THE PHONE: 76 CHARACTERS OR FEWER. The
#   operator, reading r155 on his phone: "That report spends too many lines. It's too wide. You
#   need to get it to fit single lines." r155's EV R column took the BY rows to 85 characters and
#   every one wrapped onto two lines; the R headers (92, 94), the sentiment note (100), the headline's
#   worst rows (96, 102), the single-session note and r155's own footer (115) wrapped too. The BY
#   tables keep every column and every decimal: the name column is 21 (the longest name on the
#   book, `sweep_breach_accepted`, is 21) and the numeric columns are tightened, 75 wide; EV R gets
#   room for two integer digits (`4835.00+19.64` had run together). The other lines are reworded,
#   not wrapped. check_trade_report T10 renders every mode and fails on any line over 76.
# v1.19 (2026-09-26) — OTV4TEST r155. (Numbered v1.19, not v1.1: this file carries dtp's own
#   v1.1-v1.18 as inherited history below, and a reused number reads as that entry.) AN "EV R" COLUMN IN EVERY BREAKDOWN TABLE, SETUP TYPE
#   INCLUDED. The operator, 2026-09-26: "Can you express the returns by setup type on EV
#   multiple and add that to our report 35?" — asked after dollars had made Breakout look
#   like the book's engine when it deploys ~8x Runaway's capital per trade at the SAME 43%
#   win rate. EV R = the bucket's EXPECTANCY IN R: the mean, over its trades, of each trade's
#   P&L as a multiple of the dollars its STOP put at risk (`modified_r`, the report's own
#   headline R basis), so a bucket is judged per unit risked, not per dollar of size. It is
#   the MEAN PER TRADE ("what one more trade of this kind is worth, in risk units"), which
#   is deliberately NOT the header's aggregate R (sum P&L / sum risk), where a few large-risk
#   trades carry the total. Trades whose risk cannot be priced are left out of the mean and
#   the value is flagged `~`; none priceable reads `-`. Placed before FEES $ so FEES stays the
#   last field (check_trade_report T5). NET $ and every existing column are unchanged.
#   🔑 THE BY TABLES NOW SORT BY EV R, best first (operator: "report 35 does not sort by EV");
#   NET breaks ties, and the HEADLINE's best/worst still rank by NET — its footer says so.
#   🔴 AND R ITSELF WAS WRONG FOR MOST TRADES, FOUND BUILDING THIS: `_STOP_PCT_RE` matched ANY
#   "NN%", so `orb_trail_stop pnl=30%` read as a 30% STOP — a winner's risk became its own profit
#   and it scored EXACTLY +1.00R (36 of this box's winners since 09-21), and a loser whose reason
#   carried `pnl=-12%` scored -1.00R. The header R, the per-trade R column and any EV on them were
#   close to a win/loss count. The pattern is now anchored to a stop token (`stop_N%`; this box's
#   reasons since 09-01 name stops only as hard_stop_N%, premium_stop_N%, stop_N%); a winner falls
#   back to its entry-time floor, as the docstring always said it should. Inherited from dtp's
#   trade_report v1.18 — reported to the mainline agent, not changed there by this tree.
# v1.0 (2026-09-23) — OTV4TEST r119. MAINLINE'S TRADE REPORT, READING THIS BOX'S
#   OWN trades.db. The operator, 2026-09-23, comparing our devtools item 35 with
#   mainline's reports 47/48: "Can we repurpose that code to display our
#   information like that? Theirs is reading from s3… ours would only need to
#   read the local disk", then "let's get those reports borrowed, repurposed &
#   added to our devtools menu. You can retire our current one option 35 — I
#   hate it." PORTED FROM day_trader_pro/trade_report.py v1.18 (dtp f02af8f),
#   and PROVEN BEFORE PORTING: that file, unmodified, fed this box's 138 rows as
#   one bundle, rendered every section. So the port changes WHERE rows come
#   from and nothing about how they are measured:
#   · SOURCE: `trades.db` read-only (`--db`, default OT_TRADES_DB or the repo's
#     trades.db) instead of S3-sourced JSON bundles. trade_id is the table's
#     key, so the bundle de-duplication has nothing to do and is gone.
#   · 🔴 VOID ROWS ARE EXCLUDED AND COUNTED, every run: `orb-T1`, a
#     check_standing_offer fixture the lander wrote to the live DB on 09-10
#     ("VOID: test fixture ..."), read as a real NVDA ORB trade in the
#     unmodified report.
#   · FEES: imports tests/fees.py directly — it sits beside this file, and
#     mainline's fees_bridge exists only to cross a repo boundary there is not
#     here (its own docstring says so). Still fails LOUD: n/a, never 0.00.
#   · `ettime` is not copied: its one use here is the JSON's date stamp.
#   · The row list's strategy tags gain this box's four (BRK, VOLT, HUNT, ATP).
#   · SENTIMENT: this box archives no morning report, so the section says that
#     in one line instead of naming mainline's eod_conductor.
#   Everything below this entry is mainline's history, kept because it is why
#   the numbers are computed the way they are.
# ── day_trader_pro/trade_report.py — v1.18 (mainline history) ──
# v1.18 (2026-09-07) — dtp r315 / S3.22. ENGINE_EPOCH 2026-08-25 -> 2026-09-01,
#   epoch 3, after r314 stripped every pre-09-01 trade object. The floor and
#   the bucket now agree; leaving it would default to a window whose first six
#   sessions no longer exist.
# v1.17 (2026-09-07) — dtp r312 / FEE.7. The inlined fee bridge moves to
#   `fees_bridge.py` so report 46 shares it rather than copying it. No
#   behaviour change; `bucket_fees` is imported instead of defined.
# v1.16 (2026-09-07) — dtp r311 / FEE.6. THE `<- thin` MARKER IS REPLACED BY A
#   FEES COLUMN, in every dimension table at once because `show()` is the one
#   renderer for all seven. Operator: *"the thin remark is useless. No shit
#   it's thin — it's a week of trades."* At this sample nearly every bucket
#   tripped it, so it marked the ORDINARY case and trained the eye past a
#   column that then said nothing.
#   🔑 THE MARKER GOES, THE THRESHOLD STAYS. `min_n` still gates `rank()` and
#   `exit_concentration`; this removes a DISPLAY artifact, not a guard, and
#   conflating those is how a gate vanishes inside a cosmetic edit.
#   ⚠️ `NET $` STAYS GROSS DELIBERATELY. It is the number every banked report
#   and every prior screenshot carries; changing its meaning under the same
#   header would make this delivery's own before/after incomparable. Fees
#   render NEGATIVE so the arithmetic is visible without a second column.
#   🔴 FAILS LOUD: if `fees.py` cannot be imported the column reads `n/a` on
#   every row and the header says so once — never 0.00, because "no fees" and
#   "no fee model" are different facts and the second flatters the book.
#   ⚠️ A trailing `*` marks a bucket holding rows the model could not price.
# v1.15 (2026-09-05) — dtp r287 / TZ.1 — the naive `today` here asked a UTC box and rolled at 20:00 ET (19:00 in winter), so a report run after that silently asked for TOMORROW and came back empty. It now goes through `ettime`, the one ET/UTC boundary.
# v1.14  2026-09-04 — dtp r269. MODIFIED R — ON THE STOP THAT ACTUALLY ENDED
#       THE TRADE. Operator, 2026-09-04: *"as a trader I am aware that a $1,000
#       position for me carries an actual $250 of risk"*, and compute it on the stop
#       that ended the trade. The exit reasons already carry the number —
#       `hard_stop_20%`, `stop_25%`, `hard_stop_18%` — so this is per-trade truth read
#       off the row, not a rate assumed from the strategy name.
#       🔴 IT CHANGES THE HEADLINE FROM +0.059 TO ROUGHLY +0.24. Max-loss R answers
#       "what could I have lost"; it is the WRONG denominator for "what is my return on
#       risk", and reporting only that made a working book look broken.
#       ⚠️ THREE-TIER FALLBACK, AND THE ROW SAYS WHICH: x = the stop named in this
#       trade's own exit reason, s = the entry-time floor (`stop_premium`), m = max
#       loss because neither was recorded. A winner has no stop percentage and must not
#       be given one. The roll-up prints the basis MIX, because an aggregate built
#       mostly on max-loss fallbacks is not the same measurement as one built on real
#       stops — and printing it without saying so is how the previous line misled.
#       🔑 AND IT SURFACES SLIPPAGE. A stopped trade whose modified R is worse than
#       -1.00 had its stop OVERSHOOT: NVDA at $0.06 with a `hard_stop_20%` intended
#       $228 of risk and cost $475 — -2.08R, because a 2-cent slip on a 6-cent option
#       IS 33%. Max-loss R showed that same trade as -0.42 and hid it entirely.
#       ⚠️ Max-loss R is KEPT on a second line as the honest worst case.# v1.13  2026-09-04 — dtp r269. 🔴 MODIFIED R: THE STOP THAT ACTUALLY ENDED
#       THE TRADE. Operator, 2026-09-04: *"as a trader I am aware that a
#       $1,000 position for me carries an actual $250 of risk"* — compute R
#       on that. r268's max-loss denominator answers "what could I have
#       lost"; it is the wrong denominator for "what is my return on risk",
#       and reporting it as plain R read as +0.059 when the same book on the
#       real stop reads +0.235.
#       🔑 READ OFF THE ROW, NOT ASSUMED. The exit reasons carry the number
#       — hard_stop_20%, stop_25%, hard_stop_18% — so each trade is measured
#       against ITS OWN stop. A winner has no percentage and must not be
#       given one: it falls back to the entry-time floor, then to max loss,
#       and the basis letter (x/s/m) says which on every row.
#       ⚠️ AND IT SURFACES SLIPPAGE. A stopped trade below -1.00R means the
#       stop OVERSHOT: NVDA at $0.06 on a 20% stop came out at -2.08R,
#       because a two-cent slip on a six-cent option IS 33%. AMD at $3.75
#       overshot 8%. The overshoot scales with how cheap the option is.
#       ⚠️ MAX-LOSS R STAYS on a second line as the honest worst case; the
#       two together say what neither says alone.
# v1.12  2026-09-04 — dtp r268. R AND CAPITAL AT RISK.
#       Operator, 2026-09-04: the roll-up wants an R value after median
#       hold, and the per-trade list wants a DATE (it is routinely run over
#       five sessions, which made every row's time ambiguous), an R, and
#       the capital that was at risk.
#       🔴 THE DENOMINATOR IS THE STRUCTURE'S MAX LOSS, NOT THE STOP'S.
#       Stops run 15-27%% by strategy and exit reason, so measuring against
#       them would give a different denominator per row and make the column
#       incomparable across strategies.
#       ⚠️ THE ROLL-UP PRINTS TWO NUMBERS. Aggregate R is what the BOOK
#       returned on committed capital; median R is the typical TRADE. They
#       diverge when a few large-risk trades carry the total - SPX risked
#       ~$35k a trade across 21, the runaway a few thousand across 202 -
#       and reporting one would hide exactly that.
#       ⚠️ THE DATE COLUMN REVERSES AN EARLIER NOTE that said time only,
#       because the window is in the header. True of a single session; this
#       report is routinely asked for five. entry/exit narrow 6->5 and pnl
#       8->7 to pay for it: line 45 -> 60, still inside the widest table
#       this report already prints.
# v1.11 (2026-08-31) — r202. --rows / --rows-only: ONE LINE PER TRADE.
#   Every report in the suite aggregated and none listed a trade, so "what
#   did the fleet actually do today" had no answer short of reading the
#   bundle JSON by hand. 43 chars for Termius on a phone: sym, time,
#   strategy, contracts, entry, exit, pnl. ⚠️ Exit reason is deliberately
#   absent — it has its own section, and the operator ruled that symbol and
#   contracts earn the space instead.
# v1.10 (2026-08-29) — r190 / dtp r231. THE DEDUP SHIM IS GONE, AND WHAT
#   REPLACES IT IS A DETECTOR (backlog S3.6).
#   🔑 IT WAS NEVER A DESIGN FEATURE. Its own v1.1 changelog (2026-07-22)
#   says so: before consolidate_trades v1.2 added a date filter on 07-28,
#   harvest scp'd each box's ENTIRE trades.db and consolidate did a bare
#   SELECT *, so every fleet_trades_<date>.json held that box's FULL HISTORY
#   and pooling N bundles counted each trade up to N times. The dedup existed
#   solely to survive those cumulative archives sitting in the glob. r187
#   moved the default source to reports/warehouse, where every bundle is
#   built by warehouse_reader.build() from ONE dt= partition and is already
#   collapsed by latest_per_trade(). There is nothing left to de-duplicate.
#   🔴 AND KEEPING IT WAS THE ACTUAL DEFECT, NOT MERELY DEAD CODE. TWO
#   DEDUP RULES RAN ON THE SAME DATA WITH DIFFERENT TIE-BREAKS:
#   warehouse_reader.latest_per_trade() keeps the newest `pushed_at_utc`;
#   this file kept the MOST-FILLED row (`_filled()`, a count of non-empty
#   columns). They have agreed so far because the newest state also happened
#   to be the most-filled one. **That is luck.** A trade whose final CDC row
#   nulls a column would have been silently resolved differently by each,
#   and nothing anywhere compared them — report parity could not catch it,
#   because parity runs BOTH sides through this same rule.
#   ⚠️ SO IT IS NOT DELETED, IT IS INVERTED. Silently collapsing a
#   duplicate now hides the only two conditions that can still produce one:
#   a legacy CUMULATIVE bundle in an explicit --bundles-dir, or two bundles
#   for the same date. Both are real problems and both used to be absorbed
#   without a word. Duplicates are now FIRST-WINS by sorted filename
#   (deterministic, not arbitrary) and REPORTED BY trade_id AND BY FILE.
#   ⚠️ `_filled()` is removed entirely rather than left unused. An
#   orphaned tie-break helper is exactly what gets re-wired by the next
#   person who needs 'a way to pick between two rows'.
# v1.9 (2026-08-29) — r187 / dtp r228. THREE CHANGES, backlog S3.5.
#   (1) THE DEFAULT SOURCE IS THE WAREHOUSE. The old default globbed
#       reports/fleet_trades_*.json at the repo root — a directory NOTHING
#       WRITES ANY MORE. eod_analysis v1.2 builds its bundle into
#       reports/warehouse/, and install_eod_v2.sh disabled dtp-harvest.timer,
#       so whatever sits at the root is a frozen snapshot of a pipeline that
#       stopped running (backlog C.12). A default pointing at a folder nobody
#       fills does not fail — it QUIETLY REPORTS OLD NUMBERS, which is worse.
#       --bundles-dir still overrides, and report_parity passes both sides
#       explicitly so it is unaffected.
#   (2) 🔴 AN ENGINE EPOCH, DEFAULTING TO 2026-08-25. Operator, that day:
#       "today is day one and anything prior to today was the old engines."
#       Every bundle in the warehouse reaches back to July, so an unqualified
#       cross-day run POOLS TWO DIFFERENT TRADING SYSTEMS in one table with
#       nothing marking the boundary. That has already produced one wrong
#       conclusion quoted as evidence. The floor is now the default and
#       --all-history is the explicit override.
#       ⚠️ IT IS LOUD, NOT SILENT. The count of excluded pre-epoch
#       trades prints on every run. A filter you cannot see is how you end up
#       arguing about a number that was never in the sample.
#   (3) BY SETUP GRADE IS REMOVED. Every v4 write path hardcodes
#       setup_grade="UNGRADED" (entry_engine:212, main:2135, condor_roll:789,
#       base_strategy:127) and nothing writes setup_score at all — r152
#       deleted the scorer because it SELECTED LOSERS (A-grade -$8,244 vs
#       B-grade +$1,893 over 619 trades). The section had exactly one bucket.
#       ⚠️ The COLUMN stays (check_conviction_removed S6 pins it) and the
#       field still rides on every row; only the dimension is gone, replaced
#       by one line of fact so its absence is stated rather than mysterious.
# v1.8 (2026-08-16) — --out, so a caller can name the JSON exactly. The parity
#   tool had been picking the newest trade_report_<stamp>.json by MTIME, which
#   is a guess: it read a stale full-fleet run instead of the restricted one it
#   had just produced, and reported 25 sessions against 1 as a warehouse
#   divergence. Identifying a file by "probably the newest" is not identifying
#   it.
# v1.7 (2026-08-16) — a warehouse-sourced run writes trade_report_warehouse_*
#   and records its source in the payload. v1.6 wrote the same stamped filename
#   for both sources, so the two were distinguishable only by mtime — and a
#   comparison you can only make by checking timestamps is one you will get
#   wrong once.
# v1.6 (2026-08-16) — --bundles-dir, for WH.11. Lets this report run against
#   warehouse-sourced bundles in reports/warehouse/ so the OUTPUTS of both
#   sources can be diffed — bundle-level equivalence does not establish that
#   the reports agree. Default is unchanged; the local path is byte-identical
#   to v1.5. ⚠️ Note the glob it depends on: reports/fleet_trades_*.json is
#   this report's INPUT, so anything written beside those files becomes its
#   data whether or not that was intended.
# v1.5 (2026-08-04) — HEADLINE stops printing false sentences. rank() now
#   returns how many buckets cleared the sample floor, and the printer refuses
#   the word "worst" when there is only one (it was naming the SAME bucket as
#   best and worst — day_of_week: Tuesday twice, on a single-session report) and
#   flags it as LOWEST-not-a-loss when every eligible bucket is positive
#   (2026-08-04 announced a "worst ... net +1041.50", the
#   second-best bucket, on a profit). Arithmetically right, semantically false —
#   and it is the section people skim.
# v1.4 — 2026-08-03 — EXIT SPREAD + a contaminated verdict fenced off.
#        (a) by_exit_reason and by_session_date existed as separate marginals,
#        which cannot answer the question they get asked: is an exit reason a
#        STANDING pattern or ONE session? The 2026-08-03 cumulative showed
#        bos_exit/Continuation at n=21 over nine sessions — the same 21 the
#        single-day run showed, i.e. possibly every one of them on one day,
#        while every other exit grew 3-6x. Marginals hide that; a cross shows
#        it. New EXIT REASON x SESSION SPREAD block reports, per exit reason,
#        how many distinct sessions it fired on and what share landed on its
#        heaviest one, flagging >=80% as SINGLE-SESSION. exit_x_date is also
#        written to the JSON in full.
#        (b) flag_runners_cut_early was computed over EVERY row including the
#        sub-minute flicker (main.py pre-v5.0: median hold 0.8 min, p25 12
#        SECONDS — 44 of 88 rows on 2026-08-03 alone). Those exits were a
#        DEFECT, not exit behaviour, and they drag both medians toward zero, so
#        a ratio built on them is evidence about a bug rather than about
#        leashes. Nothing is silently dropped — the ratio is now reported both
#        ways with the sub-minute count stated, and the "runners cut early"
#        NOTE is withheld when sub-minute rows exceed 10% of the sample, since
#        at that point the ratio is measuring the flicker.
# v1.3 — 2026-08-03 — +SENTIMENT dimension, and the cross that actually answers
#        the operator's question. Idea: "I didn't think it would be wise to short
#        into positive tailwinds or fire longs into headwinds." That is a claim
#        about sentiment x DIRECTION, so `sentiment_x_direction` is the cross that
#        matters — sentiment x strategy would not test it.
#        SOURCE: reports/morning_report_<date>.json, archived nightly by
#        eod_conductor v1.12.0 phase 5c. data/report.json is overwritten every
#        09:15, so before that phase the day's scores were destroyed before they
#        could be joined to that day's outcomes. Joined by (session date, symbol),
#        the same shape gap_pct uses — the score is per SYMBOL PER DAY, so every
#        trade on a symbol-day inherits one value.
#        READ THE COVERAGE LINE FIRST. `brief_strength` was a hardcoded 0.30 for
#        EVERY name every day until the DTP_REPORT_JSON fix landed after the close
#        on 2026-07-30, and archiving only began 2026-08-03 — so there is almost
#        no data yet and this dimension will be empty or trivial for weeks. It
#        prints how many trades actually carried a score rather than silently
#        ranking a handful. Expect it to become readable around 2026-09-05.
#        SELECTION TRUNCATES THE RANGE, which is worth remembering when reading
#        any result: sentiment already chooses which 13 discretionary boxes wake,
#        so only high-scoring symbols trade at all. The bands below therefore see
#        the TOP of the distribution, not its spread, and a null here is weaker
#        evidence than a null on an untruncated variable would be.
# v1.2 — 2026-07-22 — Machine-readable artifact + new dimensions. Writes
#        reports/trade_report_<last-session>.json containing every bucket with
#        full stats plus a FINDINGS block (best/worst strategy, setup,
#        symbol, hour, weekday, exit reason, and the single
#        best/worst trade). New display dimensions: by symbol, by hour (ET), by
#        weekday, by session phase, by session date. Best/worst claims only
#        consider buckets with n >= --min-n so a 1-trade bucket cannot win.
# v1.1 — 2026-07-22 — CRITICAL FIX: de-duplicate by trade_id. harvest.py scp's
#        each box's ENTIRE trades.db and consolidate_trades.py does a bare
#        SELECT * with no date filter, so every fleet_trades_<date>.json holds
#        that box's FULL history — pooling N bundles counted each trade up to N
#        times. Now keyed on trade_id; session dates derived from entry_time.
#        Also normalises exit_reason (strips ' pnl=...'), matching
#        excursion_report.norm_reason.
# v1.0 — 2026-07-22 — NEW. Cross-day trade breakdown ranked by net.
"""
Cross-day trade breakdown — what actually made and lost money, ranked.

Read-only. Pools every closed trade from the fleet_trades_<date>.json bundles
consolidate_trades.py writes, de-duplicates, and ranks across every dimension
that matters. Prints a summary and writes a data-rich JSON for further analysis
(or to hand to Claude).

Timestamps in the DB are UTC ISO (ts_for_db); hour-of-day and weekday are
converted to ET so "the 10 o'clock hour" means the market's 10 o'clock.

Usage:
    python trade_report.py                     # all banked sessions
    python trade_report.py --since 2026-07-14
    python trade_report.py --min-n 10          # thin-bucket threshold (default 8)
    python trade_report.py --live | --paper
